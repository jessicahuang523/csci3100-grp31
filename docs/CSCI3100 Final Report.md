## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Project Overview

Dubby, originated from the word “buddy,” is a service that connects university students who want to do sports but have difficulties in finding partners. For team sports such as basketball and soccer, it is hard for a person to enjoy playing if he/she cannot find enough teammates, which could result in him/her giving up on playing. On the other hand, for sports like badminton and tennis, people may want to find different opponents to play with in order to enhance their skills. In fact, according to our study, many students who love to do sports are suffering from similar scenarios, especially when they do not belong to any university sports team. Our idea is to connect all these people through Dubby so that they can hold or join a game randomly.

In this group, we have various teamworks for group members. Shann-Wei Yeh (1155100333) is in charge of the whole coding functionalities. Alexandru Jucan (1155141090) mainly worked on the functions of the gym page and profile page. Yung-chieh Huang (1155120711) designed the application appearance and focused on the functions of the chat page. Chin Hsin Chan (1155085506) is responsible for the program testing and the reports writing. Tsai Li Luan (1155075536) worked on system design, coding, the initial report and final report.

### 1.2 Objective

Our main object is to help people with similar expectations of doing sports to be connected so that students could have higher opportunities to play sports. Another goal is providing complete and correct information about each stadium inside the campus. We hope that the information could help students to utilize sports facilities better. Starting from CUHK, we eventually want to let Dubby become the no.1 service in Hong Kong for university students to find their sports partners.

### 1.3 Highlights

#### 1.3.1 Major Function

1. Events
   1. Hold/edit events
      - Dubby allows users to hold a particular sports game initiative. The creators can add descriptions such as the location, expected participants, date, and time of the game. The user can also set whether the event is open to everyone or is it private.
   2. Join/interested in events
      - A user can view the events list, and find the kind of sport event that he/she is interested in, he/she can click on the event to see the further event details (etc. time/location/number of participants required).
      - After clicking into the event details, the user can see how many people are joining/interested in the event, he/she can also click on the button to join/show their interest in the event.
      - The events list could be sorted by time/location/type of sports.
2. Gym info
   1. Check gym info
      - At this page, the user can check the gym opening time in each university and also check if there is any other people booking the gym for training or game purpose (etc. school team booking gym for training)
   2. Update gym info
      - A user can also update the gym opening time and gym pictures by updating photos or filling the form, so that other users could use the information. (Etc. menu uploading function of openrice)
3. Profile
   1. View Profile
      - Users can view both their own and other users’ profiles.
      - Edit Profile
      - Users can type in their personal info, such as their age/university/type of sports interested in. They could also type down a self-introduction in designated areas.
4. Chatting
   1. Private chat/group chat
      - Just like other chatting apps (instagram, whatsapp), users can chat with their friends/an anonymous user, or choose to open a group chat with their friends.
   2. Event chat
      - Event chat is a chat room that will automatically generated when an event is hosted, every other user that has joined the event will be automatically added into this chat room. Which means when a user has created a sport event, he/she will automatically create a event chat.
      - The Event chat will self-destruct 72 hours after the event hosting time. Before the event chat disappears, users can add each other into their friends list

#### 1.3.2 Advanced features

- Friends
  - Friends List
    - The friends that the current user has will be shown. Users could click on their friends to see their profile page, or he/she can also chat with them.
  - Search  User
    - Users can search for particular user by input his/her username
    - Users can search for other users based on their interested sports
  - Send friend request/Unfriend
    - When viewing another user’s profile, the user can send a friend request to him/her to add them into the friends list.
    - Users can also unfriend their current friends to remove them from the friends list.
- Invite
  - After the users join the event, they are able to invite their friends if the event is not fully occupied, so that users could enjoy the game with their friends together.
- Dark Theme (Purple Theme)
  - The original design is the CUHK yellow theme, which is bright and clear. Since the concept of having the dark theme protecting users’ eyes is more and more popular, we also design a dark theme version, which is CUHK purple, so that users could enjoy the brand-new user experience. (The function is just an advanced layout design, details of this feature will be less mentioned in the report)

#### 1.3.3 Expected customers and users

Our target users are students in universities in Hong Kong who would like to find partners for sports. We assume that those who are not that familiar with the university environment, who are less interested in joining a regular sports association, or who want to play a game without enough participants can use a more straightforward way to solve the problem. We expect our user base to include exchange students, non-local students, and those who want to have more partners to join their games. This program provides and integrates all the gym information in different universities, in which many students are international students. They could easily find prefered sports partners, or host the game without the problem of not enough participants.

#### 1.4 Project Statistics

In the *project statistics* sub-section, you should indicate the LOC (lines of code) and McCabe’s number (to be taught in class) of your project, including the main function and other major functions. These metrics can be as extensive as possible, and down to module level. Present your project statistics clearly, such as using a tabular format

In this program, we designed 337 functions to implement our thoughts. In total, we create 4131 lines of code to make our idea into practice. With the assistance of “sonarQube”, we calculated that the complexity of the whole project is 716 (figure 1.4.1).

For our case, it would be too complicated to count the complexity of each module separately; therefore, we listed out the complexity for each page of our program (figure 1.4.2) (etc. chat page, gym page). However, the total complexity is not the total add-up of complexity of each page because the complexity would increase when combining different functions together as there will be data exchange between them.

Users can also search the event by choosing the type of sport that he/she wants to search. By clicking on the particular event, the system will get event detail from the database and show it to the user, he/she can decide if he/she wants to join it.Host event: By clicking “+ new event!” button on the dubby homepage, the user can type in the detailed information of the event he/she wants to host. After he/she clicks “submit”, the event will be shown to every user on the events list (unless the user chooses to host a private event).Profile: Each user has their own profile, a user can also view other users’ profiles (Detailed information of this part will be given out in the level 2 diagram below).Friends & search user: When entering the friends page, the profile database will provide friends data, which includes friends list/sent friend requests/received friend requests of the current user. A search bar is also provided in the page, where he/she can search for a particular user who has a registered account. Chat: A user can chat with other users in the dubby system (Detailed information of this part will be given out in the level 2 diagram below). 2.2.3	Level 2 diagramLevel 2 diagram goes deeper into several processes in level 1 diagram that needs further elaboration, namely upload gym info, chat and profile.![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/p1jJ2_aaP_RSKYJsJ2CWO_kkxlFM_LCj8SIF5ewrBSAI3i_QoQTfsyAxPgURXaD0g1xI6iqbK2pYlIpgZsABuHfyE8uo5VmKntUQHfWkubh80AkbBxEG2U6rC5uAoiaiQ69qhRRn)Upload gym info: A user can upload two types of info, gym schedule and gym image into the database, but both are in picture format.

A user can create his/her own private chat and group chat, but an event chat is automatically created when an event is hosted. Other users will be added into this particular event chat if they join the event. 3 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS by UML 3.1 Class DiagramUser, profile & friends: Each user has one profile, and it has one own friend list. When the user is deleted, its profile and friends data will also be deleted (composition relation)Chats: Users have access to chat functions.

Users can click on the “Accept” button, and the data will be updated. The request will be removed from the received requests list and the person will be added into the friend list. 4 USER INTERFACE DESIGN4.1 Introduction of the User InterfaceThere are mainly 7 parts of user interfaces, which are login/sign up pages, My Events page, Events page, Chat page, Gym page, Profile page, and Friends page respectively, for this project. Except for login/sign up pages, which are shown before the user signs in, all the other pages with different functions are available for users to choose without extra limitation on the same interface. These pages, which are considered “main function pages” are listed out on the upper-left hand side of the website, so that users could easily find the button of function they want. On the other hand, other extra functions that are not emphasized, and people might access those pages less frequently, such as friends, night shift and log out, are all listed under the menu button. In addition, when the cursor is pointing to the designated function or button, the color of words on the button would be changed to show users clearly. For Dubby, we use Reactstrap as our layout tool to implement a Responsive Web Design, in order to create a website that will automatically fit to both desktop and mobile environments.4.2 Objects and Actions4.2.1 Login and sign up pages: Firstly, the login page (figure 4.2.1.1) would be shown before users are able to access the main page. Login is necessary for using Dubby; consequently, for those who do not have an account should click the sign up button for creating a new user account in sign up page (figure 4.2.1.2). When users are setting their email account and password, the system would check the security of the password. If the password is too short or not secure, the warning message would pop up. So as for the login page, if the email or password is entered wrongly, the notification would pop up as a reminder.Figure 4.2.1.1![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lSxpaxBgW9i0s2C3BVYKRqjDSjgiL8h_Xlbi_OF1jrddHH4fNwDp0q3gFG2ccJJrPXjNm1fJFKTqzih3DXAaG7VV-NbQwWjxf4WvOsLAn4P6awp3UcrEXGSnZsk1t8iGy_XFUeaJ) ![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BPrkkk4wVzo1eJuM1oblPZTYQHQm_iWtBqWy232_js-pLLmxchNccN_eErgAlG-m2L5olzFbH-HfelOe-srTHj9NqxUjVTkxB5yVo3z2TV_HRfJyf3-a6UOXW5HcczKi81MHP9OX) Figure 4.2.1.24.2.2 my event (dubby): ![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9K7DKua9ZF3-hfiHJnPiI4VTTS3aBSqj230CR28Hh-IDyFESzI2wosx_S_5uyfk68P9Nrq7oPxHV5lBCYMrak7TcUXP-q8Tutr6l4dJcybXmabkUDhH2_gqITzOeWjMVjXi4EYaZ)After login to Dubby, the initial page is the “My Event” page (figure 4.2.2.1), which shows all events that the user has decided to join. To access this page, users could also click the icon of “Dubby” on the left-top corner (figure 4.2.2.2). On this page, all the events that the user hosted or joined would be shown here, and the events are sorted by the event starting date. Moreover, the event that the user friends invited the user to join would also appear here. After the event starting time is over, the events would not be displayed on this page anymore. If users would like to host an event, they can create an event by clicking the “+ New Event!” button. After filling in all the required information (figure 4.2.2.3), such as event name, number of participants, sport type, location, and so on, the new event would be created and appear on the “My Event” page (figure 4.2.2.4). Or users can just select “Cancel” if they change their minds.Figure 4.2.2.1Figure 4.2.2.2![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xWlkdg_xUDmUyLRcuDMpXsv742K36zRAwCLgVWQe5fdLVku_PqtI24AiP3H1TEOc1Hybhwh2X74YlY99QfoLL-uarYZ18KZoy1CESepw2qSWSkmWEep0CfmPMI5FvlXtpeN5cIeL) Figure 4.2.2.3![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dIntTFMRShauX5q8ix6DuE3mmqPiBhD7uKPr4Wos2OTdWv0rDSpbYE8f0JmGe1J-WMSsT8LQkNcndbu6OcXX6Od9i6G2iQdhvbXaC3NCHbyYBZR0nDSQG7ffZoKv22LPBIb0XGvP)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MdqBNlArCqOrTyv6VoUlg6FR3dGEb05t9QPPPCHuVUwstQ-UKWM6kVHy0rwTOqKgFV-X6-Au3RPEbzOTq5q5e0PFho08o_bdh04FPfUKoT9cF1eOYCtNt_fq-v9METgTSrVpXYoT)Figure 4.2.2.4 4.2.3 event (public):The event page (figure 4.2.3.1) shows all the public events that are open for any user to join. There is a search bar in the upper section, where the users could find all the related events by typing the key words (figure 4.2.3.2). The lower part displays all the events that are not overdue and public for everyone. Private events would also be shown here if the users are the hosts or they are allowed to join the private events. After the event date is passed, the event card would disappear and no longer be on this page. The events are sorted by the starting date order, the event with closer dates would appear on the top. Each event card would show the information for the event as introduced at my event part above. By clicking the event card, the events details would appear. ![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gaFAVVv67ysGNKJObqDDm4sWyjNnIgQRKdh7EhjlOSfjntnjPcog6Uos0Gp-x8rAhXTAdUqmya0bHfovl2ndwDLxbEwpUwvBLEkqwrfp6QUp3cmVHlijYysZF_8vIFkeAaUPlYvq)Figure 4.2.3.1![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sjaT6javrW_xO-cGCCkX1N5Z0uBs_69ugFFUtpaLE9mQ3ts84uqlbMFK01OLqr_raqYhhWqKMbjtvznVZ7N-YUvzyRvveazU-uWwSjoNQWdFenbEjZOBD1z81daFqYJxPfJssdif)Figure 4.2.3.2 4.2.4 event card:![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aYlAgF0eTNM1-01Csi9bF3Dp2VIx0CmdhtAEZnzAjCAhk1g2kspJBifOepZiU0AH9YA9cnag6pwCN-emPcbV9Hu7DwanZcY-GmYMn-tRoKE8T3-stZqmwEaY3mzAHVK2S62Kzm4f)The event information page (figure 4.2.4.1) would be shown when the event card is selected. It shows the information of what the sport category is, whether the user has joined or not, and who the host is. For each event page, users could see the location, starting time and vacancy of events (figure 4.2.4.2). There is also a return button (figure 4.2.4.3), which would bring users back to My Events page. The host of that event would also be displayed, and users could check the profile of that host by clicking the “host” button (figure 4.2.4.4). If the user has not joined the event, there is a “join” button at the bottom. After joining the event, users are able to open the group chat for that specific event (figure 4.2.4.5). If the user is the host of events or the user has joined the event and the event allows other people to join, there are two buttons “participants” and “invited friends” on the upper area (figure 4.2.4.6). By clicking “participants,” users could see the participants who have joined the event already (figure 4.2.4.7). They could also invite their friends by clicking the “invite friends” button (figure 4.2.4.8). In addition, if the user is the host of the event, he/she can delete the event at the event page by just clicking the “delete” button (figure 4.2.4.9).Figure 4.2.4.1Figure 4.2.4.2![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6DcYPoK-ipHUpcZhEybP2Gsw5dw--wobh-mGTx5bW74z0SST6mt0setIuJrQpK1q-yT-UWVnSsHNCr6mi5D849PEdUf_mhWDMiYAUizKfeP5UldxG_3JqE1jgTZ6fnJw12lXDdGy)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dDQSF8SVZ9FSqLSGgf_QBAB3xh55YyAuvGYsaKiXIUBMIung9tPbHHIR0wWahSnLpx4PeU5_AetMNkrR9R4U6IfELc0ZWRmJ3WT27E23EUCH5xVze1bi8UdGzbqlrSJu6UMcDKgr)Figure 4.2.4.3  Figure 4.2.4.4![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mXn2PBmUgoX4Tmc-LkrbNsgU_tb9mzxp5MfqH9LTiEDjKXLgiNP3x9Vx8KVLtDBs99Y2u0jWA86Ru5AXg_Q38-57t51zzuI_iWQAH7TnlX7XBh5x631VPlSvzaq8yYGsqFHrS6xS)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LIDJwuDPJ0H1bliz7131hiDk_Wm5S_HB9woDAISdPZ08cmL2mKGQJCWtwqafrdTV3brYfrR9SJFqMkF1pMZpmN8IEfe0UWhfSOV7UDADM4Pi2SzcZJlwn2SKY52jX9BMdHMUzevO)Figure 4.2.4.5  Figure 4.2.4.6![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aKj9gaKFylCSCWxbqfp2ExhdwALJOWUXsFk04RdeRFP9LZuh2q_4mW6QEjREFLU7wsl6LK3KOnb6-GPtzCx0QCAGdK6AzprY5jH_ytq27L9CENcQkjT9YeBCU4WsQuv72zN0PPMS)![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bBZh1dFIfPOR_hDLNh7J81kIfth6v2Vvg293rOu9fB9NaPLNK8kmCpy-VZpolbTh1jW0S5zDTFk_vhok54zXlMqf04OhH6tdVyQAzcX9Gry9MpQZlrAZ4YVpEXu75IXP0iqbERdl)Figure 4.2.4.7Figure 4.2.4.8![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YO4kTWpS696_4epVL5ycQ45rsowkDv-Z0n4U80jxqGCsOMah1HIAywr_LDZMmwUwvKpl8rShHJucHFUU_t77hT1wOhByXi6lbHuRkiZmXs0KsxHixmiQNvsb7ewUxUJWbgduR8Ey)Figure 4.2.4.9![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dszBz0cubK8AzEakFLv8ZZzcwyHrBkLe7PRJvXwUYD9wIXW0YPyRScL-oAr1Fsqzfl0BQTRSJxoRPnmj0epdR4lCeTiT4w3dTjMeDFsxnNZR3e3rM2dmWFsKJf6ZmjqSYp2Njkg3) 4.2.5 chat:On the chat page (figure 4.2.5.1), all the chat records are saved here. Each chat bar represents a chatting group, with the event name, icon of the user who sent the latest message and the message they sent. The event type is shown on the right hand side. Yellow bar represents the chat is a group chat automatically created after the event is created or after the user joins the event, and green bar represents a private chat with any user's friend. Users are also able to create a new chat group by clicking the blue button on the top, so they can select any users’ friends for a group chat (figure 4.2.5.2). By clicking the private chat, users could find their friends they would like to message directly (figure 4.2.5.3). The chat history would be shown if they already have chatted before. On this page, the latest updated chat group would be pushed to the top, so that users would be noticed if there are some new messages.To enter the chat room, users could just simply click the chat group showing on the chat page. For the event group chat, users can check the participants of the event (figure 4.2.5.4), and they can also check the event detail by clicking the circle icon “i” on the right side (figure 4.2.5.5). Besides the chatting content would be shown, the time of sent message would also be stated under each chat bubble.

Gym page would list out all the gyms that the university has. Take the CUHK for an example. Users can see descriptions, pictures and the open schedule of the gym. Users can click the right and left arrows on the picture for checking the pictures and schedules (figure 4.2.6.2). Users are allowed to upload the latest gym image or schedule by selecting the file and “Upload” button (figure 4.2.6.3). Moreover, the notification would pop out when the photo upload is complete, so that users could make sure the information is updated (figure 4.2.6.4). Basically, only one gym picture would be kept for each gym, which is the first image, and the rest of pictures are the schedule that any other users uploaded. This page would only keep the latest three photos of schedule; therefore, we have at most four images totally (one gym picture and three schedule images).Figure 4.2.6.1![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aezY_GuO9d6-2K0PyC7IpxmtBk5nbJff9jmJ3-gLpo4mbA3hU63NeVD-fp32hJ92CnfRjvmMaRZ-y3UAKE-9tZ5QFXPI188TigzKRTHJ9GbYIShNx-F8knWaGWu1-RLKJEskbQlY)  Figure 4.2.6.2![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OHUJWRz3kNqnThkU5cTqYfQjQMHc9zIymwD5WWGnFbJtcilusQqAOq_4jdIS4sl-FU0k0GAEBVWgR-q6pJG3Pq1tKNYt2_kbOrNlDgbybD_CtYs9UUDa-md97c-7L6egbiMIY6G7)![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q_cUhhobdsDuMBUU0jl45g78k-an2FimO7wuJwpqQ2G1i4PJ_PzNtM-mmwFN5Tjh5ZxnQoKt-8zcbHd34p59S7HJ8XvCEVLrD-cW31agPddTIj_rP8FpSqC7oj2pzGt9G07GGLn5)Figure 4.2.6.3Figure 4.2.6.4![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ry8DtdyBPuPVJobJ8Jx9t-kFOKGWoXiDxy6oBmA9wvVdOasjYV57Wtj6TvjAQISEkpbFWBoIMI9Ban-WWKZHXHRQDF8px8Nj-AyN-33RnUHSZlF4ctbIcYJyj4xyM6Rfcfd1bPfG) 4.2.7 profile:The profile page displays the personal information that users would like to show to the public. There is a profile photo with a circle frame, user name, personal descriptions, university, and the interested sports (figure 4.2.7.1). For browsing others’ profile pages, the profile photo and information would be shown, and there is an add friend button at the bottom so that users could send the friend request for sports partners they are interested in (figure 4.2.7.2). If the user and that particular user are friends already, the add friend button would become an unfriend button (figure 4.2.7.3). On the other hand, for users themselves, they are allowed to edit their information by clicking the edit button. In the profile editing page (figure 4.2.7.4), users are able to change their profile photo by choosing the picture and uploading it. The alterations would only be saved after the save button is selected. ![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i0jA6pCoqQjcWqTr2FmY5aIQjG3YEupoVo0HTiJID5F30qZosTGN0_GaVCp7n2DXNlgjuMhroEzTq48Dwy6kbdjeEkdw_p7Q2tZomk_dCZXHwxItOOFJIWpd_EXgwrcPkVyCMgg2)Figure 4.2.7.1  Figure 4.2.7.2![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A8wHqByi0ZUKEwgVkdLe09x6OmsZWK_LqmFuSP-6nPb69xn_yH5fkLwqvboAgOkZMN0yInqERiS4VERlakkv7G6RgJfEGZxtJxuwg0clQ8DoNX1y6BvLHl37ajvec1nNzmaJNJuU)Figure 4.2.7.3![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ptrErn7oqRaeNnK2AzOjfwM0o1Kx6VI_4H_whQw6rpXL-kK-SQAfO7sO9O_SwRrmkM3qhS-_4laxi7_pkrPsOt8mpw48vs7fgvHGAPn_0PMGtXx3AGMOSVMMKCxdMCRVOnwZ8DCS)  ![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Nc4eAk1RDU1thYdgslVXF36zD1ZF75Blr9kHrJMqyrrwp2Hgn4_4FHV1UBveIRxa-1iFELYDfT_NG1XHNOx1Ept4z45lzj_IpQWqnoTna3jUXLJItoqpwzCYXX2-UAjWm_RzTtHH)Figure 4.2.7.4   4.2.8 menu (friends, purple, sign out):Under the menu, there are three different options.

There are mainly four parts on this page: searching bar, friends list, sent requests and received requests. For the searching bar, users can either type the user’s name they want to search (figure 4.2.8.3), or search by interested sports (figure 4.2.8.4). It should be noted that the searching bar is case sensitive. After clicking the button, users can select the sport they are interested in and find other users who are also interested in this sport. For the friends list (figure 4.2.8.5), it shows all the friends the user has. They can unfriend their friend by clicking the red “unfriend” button, or check their friend's profile by clicking their names. For the sent requests (figure 4.2.8.6), it shows all the friend requests the user has sent, and by clicking the “unrequest” button, the request would be retrieved. For the received requests (figure 4.2.8.7), it shows all the friend requests that are sent by other users. After clicking the “accept button”, the accepted user would become the user’s friends, listed on the friends list.

# 5 TEST
In this section, you should present the test plan, test case design, and test result of your project					In the *test overview and test plan* sub-section, you should contain your test approach, features to be tested, plan for testing, testing tools if any, and the testing environment.				In the *Case-N* sub-section, you should concern the objective of each test case, input, expected outputs, Pass/Fail criteria, and so on.		5.1 Test Overview and Test Plan For Dubby, our basic testing logic is: Testing each small parts inside different functions of Dubby (eg. data update function, submit button, file upload function) Testing the function as whole (eg. create a dummy account and test if it can successfully create an event that could be joined by other dummy accounts) Testing the whole system by registering multiple real accounts and performing different tasks according to our specification. Therefore, I would say we use an incremental testing technique and basically perform them in a bottom-up strategy. Furthermore, in the module testing, we use black box tests as our main testing method and use white box tests as assist tools. The reason behind is because black box testing is requirement based, which we believe is more suitable for our system as it contains lots of interactions between users, database and web page. The white box testing is performed every time a module is coded, in order to test the control flow inside the module is correct.In the following section, we would list out the black-box tests we have performed on each function. We have prepared various cases to ensure each part of the function is fully covered. The categories of our black box testing is sign up function, login function, functions related to events, functions within event card, chat functions, functions related to gym page, functions related to profile, functions related to friend page, dark/light mode functions, and sign out function. When we came across the problems, we tried to fix them, and the results are the final version of the test. All the test cases are listed in the table below. 5.2 sign up: 5.2.1	create an accountCase DescriptionPurposeInputExpected OutputPass/Fail Criteriaemail address with @ and **.com**, and password is strongSee if the proper way to create an account works as expectedemail: “12345678@email.com”password: 12345678Sucessfully sign upPassemail address with @ and **.com**, and password is weakSee whether proper email address but non-proper password can create an accountemail: “12345678@email.com”password: 1234The warning “ the password is too weak” should pop up, and sign up unsuccessfullyPassemail address without **@** and password is strongSee if non-proper email address with proper password can work or not email: “12345678.email.com”password: 12345678The warning “ email address should contain @” should pop up, and sign up unsuccessfullyPassemail address without **.com** and password is strongSee if non-proper email address with proper password can work or not email: “12345678@email”password: 12345678The warning “ email address is incorrect” should pop up, and sign up unsuccessfullyPass, although there is no warning pop up, but the sign up is not successful 5.3 login:5.3.1	account loginCase DescriptionPurposeInputExpected OutputPass/Fail Criteriacorrect account and correct passwordTo see if correct account and correct password can login successfullyemail: “12345678@email.com”password: 12345678Login successfullyPassincorrect account and incorrect passwordTo see if incorrect account and incorrect password can login successfullyemail: “1234567@email.com”password: 1234567The warning “Please check your email or password!” would pop out.Passincorrect account and correct passwordTo see if incorrect account and correct password can login successfullyemail: “1234567@email.com”password: 12345678The warning “Please check your email or password!” would pop out.Passcorrect account and incorrect passwordTo see if correct account and incorrect password can login successfullyemail: “12345678@email.com”password: 1234567The warning “Please check your email or password!” would pop out.Pass 5.4 event:5.4.1	create new eventCase DescriptionPurposeInputExpected OutputPass/Fail CriteriaEvent name not blank, proper number of participants, starting time is after current timeTo check if users are able to create an event as expected event information input.Event Name: This is a testParticipants allowed: 5Event type: BasketballPublic Event: YesEvent Location: Shaw College CourtStarting Date: 2020/6/25Starting Time: 11:30 A.M.Successfully create an eventPassBlank event nameTo check if users are able to create an event without event nameEvent Name: (blank)Participants allowed: 5Event type: BasketballPublic Event: YesEvent Location: Shaw College CourtStarting Date: 2020/6/25Starting Time: 11:30 A.M.The warning pops up and asks the user to fill in the Event Name.

For example, although we did draw diagrams such as DFD, and UML, we still fail to properly visualize our application using illustrations. This results in problems like pages that are coded by different people having different layouts, and missing functions/buttons that shouldn’t be forgotten. At last, we spend huge effort and time to correct these design flaws, which could be avoided since the beginning. Some parts we would do differently if we can re-do the project:ChatThe notification of chat: In the current version of Dubby. Although the chat box would be pushed to the top of the chat list when a new message is received, it won’t show any notifications to the user. To make it more convenient and instant for users, we can add the notification bell so that users could catch up the most updated message immediately. GymRedesign the layout for the gym page. The system now doesn’t allow the user to crop the image they upload to the event database, which results in images that are shown in the carousel are in different sizes. We would like to redesign this part by adding an image crop function, or even redesign the whole layout of how the images are shown. DatabaseRedesign the database structure: We should properly design the database structure in the beginning (etc. which database should save what kinds of data, the name of the key in different database) Layout DesignInitially, we designed the layout based on the size of the mobile phone monitor, and it turns out the layout looks much better on mobile devices than laptop or tablet. We might want to change the tool for designing layout (eg. React-mdl: a set of React components built on top of Material Design Lite), or even create both mobile & desktop versions of webpage so that it can better fit into different screen sizes. 
## 7 CONCLUSION
For the project, we have developed an event-based socializing app Dubby where university students can easily find their sports buddies. We analyzed students’ needs and implemented several functions into our system, including hosting & joining sport events, viewing & uploading gym schedules, a chat function, a profile function and a friend system. We drafted diagrams such as Data Flow Diagram and UML sequence diagram to help us with the design and implementation of the system, and perform module and integration testing to ensure the system has met our requirements. Although there are still flaws inside the program and we did wish to redo modules to perfect the system, we are generally satisfied with the program we have created. We tried to practice the software engineering principles and knowledge learned in class throughout our system and it did help us a lot in different stages of the engineering process.
At last, once again thanks to Professor Lyu and all the teaching assistants in the class that provide us important experience on software engineering, thank you.
