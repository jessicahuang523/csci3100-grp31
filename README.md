# Dubby

Find your sports buddy

This is the official repository for the Dubby project, originated from the CSCI 3100 Software Engineering course in The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This project utilizes Firebase, React, and some other technology and we aim to provide a platform where students in Hong Kong can more easily find their "buddy in sports" or other type of activities!
